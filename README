A program and library for calculating seismomagnetic field caused by inclined rectangular fault.

This package containes library for calculating seismomagnetic field due to fault motion,
strike-slip, dip-slip and tensile opening on inclined rectangular fault plane.
Any dip angle of fault plane are available except for 90 degree (vertical fault plane).

1. Installation

Run the following commands on the top source directry:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

By above, shared (dinamic link) library libpiezomag.so will be installed in your system.
By default, this library and relevant files, such as include files, are installed under /usr/local.
To change this, please specify prefix as follows:

$ ./configure --prefix=hoge

2. sample program

An example program "main/piez" is also contained in this package.
To run this program, do

$ ./main/piez -f <parameter file name>

For detail, please see
